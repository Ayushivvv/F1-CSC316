## 📖 Project Overview

Our project explores the world of **Formula One (F1)** through the lens of data. Since its inception in 1950, F1 has hosted over **1,142 World Championship events** across 76 seasons, 34 countries, and 77 racing circuits. Each event has generated a rich collection of data — from categorical variables like **drivers, teams, and locations** to quantitative measures such as **lap times, points earned, and pit stop counts**.

Leveraging these publicly available datasets, our team investigates the central question:

### **What Makes an F1 Champion?**

Specifically, we analyze how differences between teams and drivers, as well as race conditions and strategic choices, shape overall success in the championship.


## 🔍 Key Goals

- Explore historical and modern F1 data.
- Identify factors that distinguish champions from other competitors.
- Highlight the impact of teams, strategies, and race conditions on performance.



## 📂 Main Data Sources

We draw on several rich datasets and APIs to power our analysis:

- **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020?select=seasons.csv)** – Contains comprehensive data on F1 races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, and championships from 1950 through the 2024 season.
- **[F1 API](https://openf1.org/)** – An open-source API offering both historical and real-time data, including weather conditions, radio exchanges, starting grid positions, and DNF (Did Not Finish) indicators.
- **[FastF1 API](https://docs.fastf1.dev/)** – Grants access to lap timing, car telemetry, tyre data, weather data, session results, and event schedules.

## 🖥 Other Sources

Sources that didn't provide csv's but still had valuable data and visualizations we could double-check our other data with.
- **[Formula 1 Official Website](https://www.formula1.com/en/results/2025/races)** – Provides race-level summaries such as winners, teams, lap counts, and times.
- **[Big Data F1](https://www.bigdataf1.com/)** – A supplementary source providing F1 data and statistics.
